  - Alex McCaskey to be invited to subsequent meetings
  - Communication:<br/>
    > *"The steering committee meets once a month. The meetings are not open to
    the public at this time, but minutes will be published on [link]. The
    steering committee may invite domain experts and repository maintainers to
    join the discussions. Please reach out to [email] if you would like to
    propose a topic for consideration and/or would like to volunteer your time
    and expertise."*
- Repos maintainers can attend steering committee meetings
- Q2B presentation
  - Title and abstract: <br/>
    >*“**Empowering heterogeneous quantum computing of today and tomorrow with
    >QIR**<br/>
    Quantum computing systems and languages evolve at a fast pace, promising
    exciting advances in how classical and quantum computations can interact at
    the hardware level. To provide interoperability between different frameworks
    and accelerate progress for all parties, it is imperative for the ecosystem
    to develop and share a forward-looking quantum intermediate representation
    (QIR) that leverages state of the art compiler technology capable of
    supporting the full variety of heterogenous quantum processors. <br/>
    The QIR Alliance is a joint effort to develop an intermediate representation
    that enables full interoperability within the quantum ecosystem, and
    provides a holistic program representation suitable for taking full
    advantage of the unique and distinct capabilities of present and future
    quantum processors. <br/>
    In this session we will explore critical advances based on three examples
    that illustrate the novel opportunities for a spectrum of use cases arising
    from this effort.”*
- Mode of operation and communication of code repositories
  - Addition of the following repos: PyQIR, QAT, QCOR
  - Requirements for code repositories:
    >*"Anyone can ask to add an open-source repository under the QIR Alliance,
    and the steering committee will approve or deny the request depending on
    whether the minimum requirements as outlined below are satisfied. The
    steering committee may also solicit such contributions.* <br/>
    >*For code repositories under the QIR Alliance,*
    >
    > - *At least two maintainers need to be designated for the repository, and
            a way to contact the maintainers should be shared with the steering
            committee.*
    > - *The repository is either actively maintained by the maintainers or the
            repository is archived.*
    > - *The code of conduct aligns in spirit with the code of conduct of the
            broader org.*
    > - *The project should be related in content to the scope defined for the
            QIR Alliance.*
    > - *All code should be licensed under MIT license, and contributors to the
            repository must accept a CLA defined by the maintainers.* <br/><br/>
    >
    > *The QIR Alliance will reach out to the maintainers if a repository no
      longer satisfies these criteria to reach an agreement and resolve the
      situation. If the maintainers cannot be reached or are unable or unwilling
      to take action, the QIR Alliance reserves the right to archive the
      repository."*

## Additional notes

- Add Anti-trust statement as one of the slide for steering committee meetings
- Non-member SMEs invited by steering committee member should only attend for
  the relevant portion of the meeting and include a statement that presented
  information is public.
- JDF can help setting-up a site but there would be a fee.
- JDF needs a FAQ that they can use to help answer questions from parties
  interested in QIR Alliance (some Platinum members already expressed interest).
- Attending Q2B:
  - Honeywell: Pete Campora
  - Microsoft: Bettina Heim, Chris Granada, Fabrice Frachon, Viktor Veis
  - ORNL: Not attending
  - QCI: Tom Lubinski
  - Rigetti: Kalan Snyder
- Adding external code:
  - Do not accept anything that contain something like a GPL license as it
    relicenses the entire code.
  - Should be ok to add copyrighted materials (Seth following-up)
- Press release
  - Members will be amplifying on their social channels but no specific blog
    planned.
- We should create an Info@ and legal@ alias to direct interest (Fabrice to
  investigate best option).
