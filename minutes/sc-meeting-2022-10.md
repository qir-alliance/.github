## Recap and status

- The Steering Committee meeting times will be fixed but alternating, with one month
at 8 am and the other month at 11 am (the latter to be confirmed by poll).
- Thank you all for providing a quote for the blog post.
- The Linux Foundation marketing team has changed and has new requirements for 
the blog post.
- The final version of the post will be sent by email, then once approved, will 
be posted onto the QIR Alliance website's announcement tab first.
- The Base Profile specification is closed, and checked in the repo.
- The Base Profile specification will get a version number 1.0 once the two other
new workstreams are completed.
- The Adaptive base profile specification has been drafted.
- The website is up and running and can be accessed directly from GitHub;
it has a News section for announcements.
- 40 to 60 people attended the QIR workshop at IEEE Quantum Week (30 people in 
the room, and 24-30 people online).
- We reached out to IEEE organizers for approval to share publically the recordings
after the on-demand period ends on November 15th.
- The workshop worked very well, and we look forward continuing on the next few years, 
and using it as a goalpost.
- There is an upcoming international conference on compilation in Paris in July 2023.
- There is a call for nomination of volunteers on the OpenQASM Steering Committee.
- Start considering a good venue for early next year to share what was accomplished 
since the creation of the QIR Alliance.
- Quotes will be shared at the Github conference where we get explicit approval.
- Community calls are going well, for instance Entropica Labs shared an update on
their development of open QAOA algorithms, and QIR generation using Classiq is an 
upcoming presentation.
- The workstream on how initializing and finalizing runtime libraries is progressing
quite well.

## Follow-ups / Action items

- Create a branch and PR for the Adaptive profile.
- Publish artifacts for the runtime initialization workstream.  
- Post on the website venue details for the international conference on compilation
happening in July 2023 in Paris.
