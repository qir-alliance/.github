## Recap and status

- Update from NVIDIA and Microsoft: Alex M. will continue to be Steering Committee delegate for NVIDIA. Bettina will be also representing NVIDIA. Bill and Sonia will be the delegates for Microsoft going forward.
- Bettina has offered to stay as Chairperson.
- A Supermajority vote (no less than 3/4 of the Steering Members) is needed to elect a new Chairperson. We clarified the process and duties of the Chairperson and we will hold the yearly election at the December Steering Committee
meeting.
- Bill has been designated by the Steering Committee to approve the Adaptive Profile PR on behalf of the Steering Committee.

## Key decisions (all voted unanimously, one member absent)

- The Chairperson should always be elected with a vote by the Steering Committee.
- The Chairperson is appointed for a duration of a year or until their affiliation changes and they can be reelected.
- In principle, the Chairperson can be from an external organization, but the
role won't be advertised more broadly and the appointment requires a vote.
- Core maintainers of the QIR Alliance will be listed to recognize their contributions on a vote by the Steering Committee. Core maintainers will not hold special provilege.
- The QIR runner, a basic simulator capable of running targeted and untargeted QIR, will be moved to the QIR Alliance repo.
