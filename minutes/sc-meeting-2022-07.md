## Recap and status

members to contribute to Quantum training content.
- The QIR community is making good progress on the Base Profile and getting it wrapped up.

at a later stage e.g. analog hardware or programs that do not compile against
the Base Profile and need a more advanced profile.

## Follow-ups / Action items

- At the next Steering Committee meeting, we will look at the PR for its approval.
- All Steering Committee members to check in their broader org for suggested topics
e.g. produce short videos that can highlight their hardware efforts.
- Kalan to reach out to Travis on their plans in regard to the Steering Committee
membership.

Member attendance.
