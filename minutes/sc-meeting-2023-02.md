## Meeting agenda

- Recap and status
- Adaptive profile workstream
- QIR Community calls
- 2023 conferences
- Next steps

## Recap and status

- The adaptive profile should be interesting to Measurement-based Quantum Computing
  and well-suited to large optical systems. The Steering Committee recommends
  contacting two companies in the photonics space to gauge their interest in
  joining as new members or as contributors to the profile specification.

- There is now an outline for the Adaptive profile workstream, so it should be
feasible to make some headway.

- The Runtime Initilization workstream is set out to define functions and their
signatures for initialization and finalization.

- Gate sets can be defined outside of the specification, and defined by the backend.
The QIR tooling will give the option to specify what gate set to use.

## Follow-ups / Action items

- Publish the document with the output schema
- Cover 2023 conferences at the next Steering Committee
