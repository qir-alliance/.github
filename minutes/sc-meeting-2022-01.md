    org page

- Identified three potential workstreams for consideration

  - Runtime initialization/finalization and entry point definition
  - Discoverability and availability of materials and demos

## Key decisions (all voted unanimously, one voting member absent)

- Community forums:
  - QIR channel on Unitary Fund Discord is a good venue to point people to
  - Unitary Fund will set up community calls for QIR

## Follow-ups / Action items

- Bettina to fix the typos pointed out in [spec issue
  #5](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-spec/issues/5).
- Alex M. to fill workstream description for extending the specification to
  include runtime initialization/finalization and entry point handling
- Bettina and Tom will follow up with Celia Merzbacher (QED-C), action items
  related to creating comprehensive materials to be defined later

## Additional notes

- Workstreams:
  - [Template](../workstreams/Workstream_Creation_Template.md) for workstream
    creation
  - Draft for [Base-Profile
    workstream](../workstreams/Base_Profile_Workstream.md) definition; <br/>
    to be discussed, refined and voted upon during the next weeks
  - Workstream for runtime initialization/finalization and entry point
    definition to be discussed in the next SC meeting
- A given QIR Profile can evolve over time through versioning.
- PIRQ and QIR Alliance are very complimentary efforts and QED-C provides a
  valuable channel of communication. PIRQ is primarily focused on facilitating
  usage and improvement of existing technical solutions while the QIR Alliance
  is defining and evolving a technical solution. The QIR Alliance can benefit
  from getting input/requirements from PIRQ and get validation of its work by
  PIRQ members.
