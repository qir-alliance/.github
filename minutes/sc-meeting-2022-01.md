    and will be linked on the QIR Alliance org page

    org page

## Follow-ups / Action items

- Fabrice to set up meeting at an earlier time so that people from Europe can
  join
- Bettina to fix the typos pointed out in [spec issue
  #5](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-spec/issues/5)
- Bettina to follow up regarding options for CLA bots

## Additional notes

- Workstreams:
  - [Template](../workstreams/Workstream_Creation_Template.md) for workstream
    creation
  - Draft for [Base-Profile
    workstream](../workstreams/Base_Profile_Workstream.md) definition; <br/>
    to be discussed further, refined and voted upon during the next weeks
  - Workstream for runtime initialization/finalization and entry point
    definition to be discussed in the next SC meeting
- A given QIR Profile can evolve over time through versioning.
- PIRQ and QIR Alliance are very complementary efforts and QED-C provides a
  valuable channel of communication. PIRQ is primarily focused on facilitating
  usage and improvement of existing technical solutions while the QIR Alliance
  is defining and evolving a specific technical solution. The QIR Alliance can
  benefit from getting input/requirements from PIRQ and get validation of its
  work by PIRQ members.
