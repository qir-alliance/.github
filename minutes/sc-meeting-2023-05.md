## Recap and status

- Workstreams update. The aim is the end of June for the write-up of the
Runtime Initialization and Finalization specification. Quantinuum and Xanadu
are the main drivers of the Adaptive profile. Bi-weekly meetings to define the
profile are open to parties who are interested in contributing.
- QIR Alliance project organization. A set of goals will be determined every year.
This year the Adaptive profile is the main objective. There is a push in the
organization's direction to be the reference for implementing authoritative
tools.
- New members or contributors to the specifications. D-WAVE would like to
engage with the QIR Alliance, and Oxford Quantum Circuits may be another
interested party.
- Conferences. The plan is to leverage more conferences to communicate the
goals of the Alliance, e.g. IEEE Quantum Week.

## Follow-ups / Action items

- Discuss the list of priorities in the next meeting.
