# QIR Alliance Project Charter

This document summarizes the parts of the Project Charter outlining the process
under which the QIR Alliance operates.

## 1. Joint Development Foundation

The QIR Alliance ("the Project") is a subsidiary/series of [Joint Development
Foundation Projects, LLC](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/). The Joint
Development Foundation’s role in the Project is limited to confirming that
Projects conduct their activities in accordance with the Joint Development
Foundation’s corporate purpose and policies, such as its non-profit status and
regulatory guidelines. Projects are otherwise independent.

## 2. Membership Levels

### 2.1. Steering Members

Steering Members are organizations that sign a legal agreement capturing the
ideas summarized in the documents on this repository. They may participate in
each Working Group and the Steering Committee. The Steering Member designates an
individual to represent the organization in Steering Committee meetings.
The current Steering Committee votes on accepting new Steering Members
taking the following factors into consideration, among other aspects:

- Organization has demonstrated a sustained interest and commitment in
  standardizing a quantum intermediate representation.
- Organization has a track record of public efforts and contributions that
  benefit the quantum ecosystem.
- Organization has an active implementation effort to contribute to and/or
  integrate with the standard(s) developed under the QIR Alliance.
- Organization has demonstrated good faith in advancing quantum computing.
- Organization will enhance Steering Committee geographic and/or business model
  diversity.
- Availability of seat(s) in the steering committee.

### 2.2. General

General Members may participate in each Working Group, but do not participate on
the Steering Committee. New parties may join the Project upon Approval of the
Steering Committee.

### 2.3. Contributor

Contributors may participate in Working Group(s) designated by the Steering
Committee, but do not participate on the Steering Committee and are not eligible
to participate in decisions that require a Supermajority Vote.

## 3. Organization

### 3.1. Steering Committee

The Steering Committee is the body that is responsible for governing the
Project, coordinating Working Groups, and managing assets. No more than two 
delegates from each organization can attend a 
Steering Committee meeting.

### 3.2. Chairperson

The Project will have a Chairperson whose responsibilities include leading the
Steering Committee, organizing meetings, organizing voting, identifying new
Working Groups, managing finance, tracking Working Group progress, ensuring
Working Group meet their goals, and any other activities Approved by the
Steering Committee. The Chairperson may delegate responsibilities to another
party. The Steering Committee may Approve a new Chairperson. The Chairperson 
may designate an interim chair if they may be absent from one Steering Committee 
meeting. The Chairperson can be an external person. The Chairperson doesn’t 
have to be an employee of one of the Steering Committee member organizations. 
The Chairperson doesn’t have any voting privilege unless listed explicitly. 
The Chairperson is automatically reelected for up to 4 years. The Steering 
Committee may approve a new Chairperson at any time.

### 3.3. Rhythm of Business

The seat of a Steering Member may be vacated if a Steering Committee delegate
is not designated or absent for more than one third of Steering Committee meetings
in one year without the prior consent of the Steering Committee. A Steering Member
can nominate a temporary stand-in. Prior consent can be requested to the Steering
Committee by sending a written communication to the chairman for consideration at
the next Steering Committee meeting. If approved, the chairman will send a written
confirmation that the request has been granted. An organization should make sure
to have an updated contact on file. By default, we consider the retirement of
Steering Members once a year, but the Steering Committee is free to add a new
member throughout the year.

## 4. Decision Making

### 4.1. Voting and Approval

The Steering Committee will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus. Where
the Steering Committee cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular
decision, the Steering Committee will make that decision by a Supermajority
Vote.

### 4.2. Appeals

Steering Committee decisions may be appealed by issuing a written appeal to the
[Chairperson](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com), and that appeal will be considered
by the Chairperson and the Steering Committee in good faith. The Chairperson
will respond in writing within a reasonable time.

## 5. Due Process

The Project adheres to consensus-based due process, including openness, balance,
adequate notice and review periods, and fair and impartial consideration of
views and objections.

## 6. Working Groups

The Project may have multiple Working Groups, and each Working Group will
operate as set forth in its Working Group Charter.

## 7. Antitrust

The Steering Members, General Members, and Contributors acknowledge that they
may compete with one another in various lines of business and that it is
therefore imperative that they and their respective representatives act in a
manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and regulations. Each
Steering Member, General Member, and Contributor may have similar agreements
with others. Each Steering Member, General Member, and Contributor may design,
develop, manufacture, acquire or market competitive deliverables, products and
services, and conduct its business, in whatever way it chooses. No Steering
Member, General Member, or Contributor is obligated to announce or market any
products or services associated with or based on the Project. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Steering Members, General Members, and
Contributors agree not to have any discussion relating to any product pricing,
methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets, allocation of
customers or any other topic that should not be discussed among competitors.

## 8. Code of Conduct

The Project has adopted the terms of the Code of Conduct available
[here](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/Code_of_Conduct.md). To
report an issue or concern under this Code of Conduct, contact the Project
Chairperson or the Joint Development Foundation General Manager.

## 9. Use of Trademarks

### 9.1. Participant Name or Marks

The Project may use any Steering Member’s, General Member’s, and Contributor’s
logo, trademark or service mark to identify the party as a Project member. All
other uses are subject to that party’s express prior written authorization.

### 9.2. Approved Deliverable Identification

Any Working Group use of a Project trademark, including for Approved
Deliverables, must be Approved by the Steering Committee.

## 10. Disclaimers for Distributions

Any distributions of technical information to third parties must include a
notice materially similar to the following: “THESE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS
