## Meeting agenda

- Presentations by OQC and IonQ
- Open discussion on QIR current and envisioned usage

## Notes

- See presentations folder fo slide decks
- Topics discussed:
  - Different actors pulling QIR in different directions (hardware providers,
    physicists, compiler engineers, etc)
  - Two main types of usage for QIR:
    - As an input language to a hardware service.
      - In this case, QIR is usually parsed and transformed into an internal
        language of the hardware provider
      - Usually, this is used by services who use the base profile and/or do
        not support mixing classic and quantum primitives
    - QIR is linked at runtime and executed on the hardware control system of
      the hardware provider
      - In this case, an in-house hardware control system is the norm (by
        opposition to an external solution like Quantum Machines)
  - A vision: "QIR as a logical schematic"
    - In this vision, the user expresses a high-level intent in QIR, and the
      compiler of the hardware provider then optimizes the user program for
      execution on their hardware
    - This vision pushes towards adding more high-level primitives in QIR, so
      that the user includes less low-level logic in their QIR program (e.g.,
      quantum gates)
  - Another need for QIR: embedding assembly in QIR
  - The implicit objective of QIR to be universally portable makes sense, but
    in the short term hardware providers need ways to fine-tune execution of
    QIR on their machines. Today users wants to express precise sequences of
    gates in QIR.
  - QIR would benefit from having a public roadmap

## Next steps

- Organize another meeting of 1.5 hours in 3 months
  - Topic: what is the right level for quantum primitives in QIR?
- Upload hardware providers presentation to GitHub folder
- QIR alliance to discuss the topic of a public roadmap
