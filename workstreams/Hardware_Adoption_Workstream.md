# Workstream: QIR Adoption by Hardware Companies

## Motivation & Benefits

The goal of QIR is to provide a representation which can connect any piece of
software with any piece of hardware. It is therefore vital to make sure that
it fits the needs of hardware manufacturers, so that QIR becomes a de-facto
standard.

The goal of this workgroup is to gather hardware manufacturers who are already
using QIR for their needs, or are thinking about doing so, in order to identify
valuable developments that will support QIR adoption by quantum computer
manufacturers.
